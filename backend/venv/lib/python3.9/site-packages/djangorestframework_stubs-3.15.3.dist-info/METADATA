# pep484 stubs for Django REST framework

Mypy stubs for [Django REST Framework](https://pypi.org/project/djangorestframework/).
Supports Python 3.8 and up.

## Installation

```bash
pip install djangorestframework-stubs[compatible-mypy]
```

To make mypy aware of the plugin, you need to add

```ini
[mypy]
plugins =
    mypy_drf_plugin.main
```

in your `mypy.ini` file.

## FAQ

### Model instance is inferred as `Any` instead of my `Model` class

When subclassing `ModelSerializer`, add a [type argument](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/#generics) to type-hint the related model class, for example:

```python
class MyModelSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer[MyModel]):
    class Meta:
        model = MyModel
        fields = ("id", "example")
```

Which means that methods where the model is being passed around will know the actual type of the model instead of being `Any`. The `instance` attribute on the above serializer will be `Union[MyModel, typing.Sequence[MyModel], None]`.
